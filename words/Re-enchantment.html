	<p> Re-enchantment...Can you honestly and truly say that you have experienced such a thing? A "re" (turn) to enchantment insinuated that somewhere along the road, we lost the battle that granted us enchantment, and we now, live without it. Nobody can claim to know when this occurred, if it occurred at a distinct time in history, in our personal lives or both. </p>
<p> I was first introduced to the word in high school sociology class(1) when we studied Max Webers: Disenchantment of the world. Weber identified the </p>
<p> we associate it with magic, spirituality, folk mythology, fiction and fantasy, </p>
<p> (1) NERD!! Somehow using my combined baby-marxist and teacher's pet powers, I remember that class very clearly. </p>
<p> In many cultures (from Native American to Siberian), stories are not just told; they are <strong> attended to </strong> as ritual acts that maintain the world. By listening with perfect attention and then retelling, the people participate in the ongoing creation and repair of reality. To forget a story, or to tell it carelessly, is not just a cultural loss; it is a literal disenchantment, a fraying of the world-soul. Attention here is an ecological and spiritual necessity. </p>
<p> The entire book is a manual for re-enchantment through attention. The Fox's secret—<em> "What is essential is invisible to the eye... It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important" </em>—is the core thesis. The Prince's attentive rituals (pulling up baobabs, watching sunsets, caring for his unique rose) are what make his small planet sacred. The adult characters—the king, the geographer, the businessman—are all models of <strong> disenchantment through inattention </strong>, seeing only abstractions, numbers, and labels, never essences. </p>
<p> The enchantment of the forest spirits is revealed only to the two young girls, Satsuki and Mei, precisely when they are in states of openness, playfulness, and distress—states of raw, unfiltered attention. The adults are largely oblivious. The magical Catbus appears not on command, but when needed by an attentive heart. The film suggests that enchantment is the <strong> native state of the world for those who pay attention like a child </strong>. </p>

<h3> Is to lie down </h3>

<h3> To learn something </h3>

<h3> A little while </h3>

<h3> Lens of attention. </h3>
