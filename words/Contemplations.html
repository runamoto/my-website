<h2> Contemplations of a freshly turned 23 year old girl </h2>
<h3> I was very lethargic when I wrote this, I had recently cancelled an event I was going to host for my friends, and was thinking about the time I spent so far as a fresh graduate. </h3>

<div class="body">

<p> Wrote a long letter filled with the feelings you can maybe only have midair<br></br>like "my soul is flying with me" and so on and "I don't believe in technocratic dystopia(?)" </p>
<p> October 7 happened one week into a re-reading of Paradise Lost.<br></br>I actually don't know how I would have held my soul together through that time if I wasn't studying Paradise Lost </p>
<p> On the other hand there is always a disaster and<br></br>a catastrophe happening, but </p>
<p> It's also true that my practice started in a<br></br>catastrophe and because of one<br></br>And maybe it's in the DNA of the projects that<br></br>somehow what we are<br></br>doing is converting energies of<br></br>collapse and chaos<br></br>into .... </p>
<p> I don't know, into something<br></br>that will endure.<br></br>It's an act of will but I don't understand it. But it's also so intuitive which means- I don't<br></br>understand it.<br></br>But I obey it.<br></br>Anyways I wrote my long loopy absurd letter about the soul<br></br>and<br></br>then I found out about mass shootings in Providence and on Bondi Beach<br></br>and I opened Instagram and there is video of students huddling together and the sound of live gunfire. </p>
<p> <em> <strong> I swear it's like were being eaten alive by our own images </strong> </em> </p>
<p> What I mean is<br></br>I think why I wanted to study The Ten Commandments/Quran/Plum Village/Lotus Sutra<br></br>Like really deeply meditate<br></br>into them<br></br>Is I feel like "moral grandeur and spiritual audacity" are gone<br></br>We are becoming incapable of thinking and acting ethically because our complicity and sense of powerlessness runs so deep<br></br>I mean like<br></br>I just feel like language itself is so deluged in sophistry<br></br>its losing this sacred fidelity to reality<br></br>But like, losing<br></br>reality is fucking up our imagination too<br></br>Taking action and living one's life increasingly<br></br>becomes a<br></br>calculated gesture<br></br>Maybe this is why fashion is so consoling<br></br>And so important right now<br></br>Because it's a way to exert some kind of control over the imprint your soul makes as it moves through this world<br></br>It's not that I don't love it. I love it dearly. And I honestly think human beings are much less horrible than we're being led to believe; coerced into being.<br></br>Like, it's this machine like part of us that is<br></br>showing us how seriously ugly </p>
