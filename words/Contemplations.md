<h2> Contemplations of a freshly turned 23 year old girl </h2>
<h3> I was very lethargic when I wrote this, I had recently cancelled an event I was going to host for my friends, and was thinking about the time I spent so far as a fresh graduate. </h3>
</div>
<div class="body">

Wrote a long letter filled with the feelings you can maybe only have midair
like "my soul is flying with me" and so on and "I don't believe in technocratic dystopia(?)"

October 7 happened one week into a re-reading of Paradise Lost.
I actually don't know how I would have held my soul together through that time if I wasn't studying Paradise Lost

On the other hand there is always a disaster and
a catastrophe happening, but

It's also true that my practice started in a
catastrophe and because of one
And maybe it's in the DNA of the projects that
somehow what we are
doing is converting energies of
collapse and chaos
into ....

I don't know, into something
that will endure.
It's an act of will but I don't understand it. But it's also so intuitive which means- I don't
understand it.
But I obey it.
Anyways I wrote my long loopy absurd letter about the soul
and
then I found out about mass shootings in Providence and on Bondi Beach
and I opened Instagram and there is video of students huddling together and the sound of live gunfire.

***I swear it's like were being eaten alive by our own images***

What I mean is
I think why I wanted to study The Ten Commandments/Quran/Plum Village/Lotus Sutra
Like really deeply meditate
into them
Is I feel like "moral grandeur and spiritual audacity" are gone
We are becoming incapable of thinking and acting ethically because our complicity and sense of powerlessness runs so deep
I mean like
I just feel like language itself is so deluged in sophistry
its losing this sacred fidelity to reality
But like, losing
reality is fucking up our imagination too
Taking action and living one's life increasingly
becomes a
calculated gesture
Maybe this is why fashion is so consoling
And so important right now
Because it's a way to exert some kind of control over the imprint your soul makes as it moves through this world 
It's not that I don't love it. I love it dearly. And I honestly think human beings are much less horrible than we're being led to believe; coerced into being.
Like, it's this machine like part of us that is
showing us how seriously ugly
