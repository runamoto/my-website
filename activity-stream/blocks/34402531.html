<p > I implemented saving and outputing html files and a mechanism to traverse levels. Just have to make it a little smoother to work. Right now its very jaggedy, mostly because I don't know how it should work. </p>
<p > The current implementation outputs the html file with a SOURCE_PATH variable which can be used to navigate back to the source files. I think this is the way to do it. </p>
<p > Also re-watched Nada Amin's <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrKj4hYic5A"> Programming should eat itself </a> talk which I think got the cogs turning for me about metaprogramming. Though the talk mostly goes over my head. </p></div>
