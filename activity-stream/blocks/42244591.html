I don't want to do tracking of any kind, just some kind of acknowledgement or something that there is a presence in this space. Maybe its a button that viewers can click to be like, "Yo" \n\n- A comment system of some kind perhaps?\n\n- Link to other posts on the feed as references. This should be easy to implement as all the images and videos are already block references. For here I could link another block that probably talks about how this feed works on are.na or smth\n\n- Also wanna do a recap of this year. Things from this feed, things not on this feed, general reflection of tying things up and where to go as the new year approaches.\n\n- A tangential blog for longer form writing and project tracking/ case study kind of thingies. Where there's evergreen notes and maybe tutorials, WIP thoughts, drafts, essays, etc. I think this feed has been a really nice space for me to put stuff on that motivates and even structures my making. I want to have such a journal for long form projects now.\n\n- also wanna implement something like this: <a href = "https://liqvidjs.org/"> liqvid.js </a> so I can have like tutorials, or showcase something or present something without actually making a video but writing it in sort of an essay but it turns into a video. I could probably narrate it and use the transcript... smth smth.\n\n","color":"2"},{"id":41831852,"x":6206.93394097667,"y":2010.3541887048902,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/41831852/9b8de84601354badc73144a57ef9ed2d.mp4?1765867145","color":"2"},{"id":41831851,"x":6762.245840991761,"y":1730.9622720019688,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/41831851/c5ef23de7b62dc6e53c18781496bd5e5.mp4?1765867140","color":"2"},{"id":41831815,"x":7027.74763215599,"y":1148.7086095162456,"width":474.37739451986715,"height":623.658905869542,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/41831815/f8f00108882556941c14588d533c5aed.mp4?1765866911","color":"2"},{"id":41831814,"x":6576.729435326001,"y":1704.4694403489577,"width":714.2342048906941,"height":580.04857671121,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/41831814/a1656b8381b87e8aca7ad155ed52874f.mp4?1765866907","color":"2"},{"id":41831797,"x":6143.365483563808,"y":1110.867187523624,"width":122.14012054872309,"height":90.27103385609594,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/41831797/edd7b7ee953461f05c89d140285d8028.mp4?1765866815","color":"2"},{"id":41831782,"x":6419.465136625396,"y":1530.0682268226296,"width":330.1278442269224,"height":313.3546407044863,"type":"link","url":"https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/41831782/original_49d9cb46bb62247f2e2c401db229e8c1.gif?1765866708","color":"5"},{"id":41831780,"x":5804.785437174352,"y":1203.2975728623921,"width":436.202197802198,"height":934.158241758242,"type":"text","text":"# Folding Problems\n\nI've been working on this for a month. but essentially this was the problem:\n\n<div class="image"><img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI0MTgzMTc1NS9vcmlnaW5hbF80ZmQ2MDgxNDIwMmYwYzIxYTg1ZDk1NjNmMTQ3OGVmMS5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /></div>\nGiven a fold line on a sheet of paper, find how the paper would fold. So calculate the vector coordinates for the shape after these two quads are folded.\n\nIt took me quite some time to figure this out. I had to go back to high school math, and re-learn all the stuff I slept through. Revised on how to find perpendicular lines, what the slope/gradient of a line is. The constructing triangles using perpendicular line, using triangles soh cah toa properties to calculate the reflected points, etc...\n\n<div class="image"><img src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/41831782/original_49d9cb46bb62247f2e2c401db229e8c1.gif?1765866708?bc=0" /></div>\n\nAfter bunch and bunch of failed attempts I got something like this working. Even after getting this working I had to tweak some stuff because it wouldn't work for all directions and what not.\n\nThen once I had this working for a single fold, I was like cool, let me try for two folds!\n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/41831797/edd7b7ee953461f05c89d140285d8028.mp4?1765866815 controls loop></video></div>\n\nAnd that worked by just incrementally reflecting all the points past a fold and iterating through them... Eventually made it so I can edit foldlines and have multiples.\n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/41831814/a1656b8381b87e8aca7ad155ed52874f.mp4?1765866907 controls loop></video></div>\n\nAnd then finally, given a printed surface with say some image or graphic on it, how would the graphic look folded up given the fold lines. This one was more tough than I thought and it still break sometimes if the angle of rotation is more than 180 degrees, which I need to figure out how to fix. But still it looks so awesome and feels gratifying! \n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/41831815/f8f00108882556941c14588d533c5aed.mp4?1765866911 controls loop></video></div>\n\nI find this video the coolest. \n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/41831851/c5ef23de7b62dc6e53c18781496bd5e5.mp4?1765867140 controls loop></video></div>\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/41831852/9b8de84601354badc73144a57ef9ed2d.mp4?1765867145 controls loop></video></div>\n\nAlthough its funny cause when I print it out and fabricate it... it just feels like... oh cool you printed on a long piece of paper and folded it up :) I shall figure out some use case for this now that I've implemented it :P ","color":"2"},{"id":41831755,"x":6495.303214949372,"y":1102.0820922292774,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"link","url":"https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiI0MTgzMTc1NS9vcmlnaW5hbF80ZmQ2MDgxNDIwMmYwYzIxYTg1ZDk1NjNmMTQ3OGVmMS5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjE4MDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTgwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==","color":"2"},{"id":41429470,"x":2218.3195718398556,"y":2388.668104434643,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"text","text":"# Added project pages and some view options\n\nAdded project pages, you can probably see this on the right here ->\n\nThere's also some new view options.

And I'm extremely happy with that decision and it has brought nothing but joy to me. However I think I need to interact with it for professional reasons.\n\nSo I've been thinking of alternative ways I could use it. One approach was Amir mentioning how he would have a system to only check and update it on one day in a month. So all stuff would get posted then. That I thought was interesting.\n\nThe one I just thought of was maybe, all the content and posts point outside of instagram. So for instance all of them are screenshots of my feed.a-p.space or website sketches. Or links to other peoples websites, etc. The whole point would be that these would all point outside of instagram. A link in bio interface that could open like instagram feed view and have links mentioned in each of the posts for easy access, so it is easy to get out of instagram as you enter it instead of being trapped in it.\n\nThis is an idea for an experiment. Perhaps I'll try it out.\n","color":"2"},{"id":41255086,"x":4192.040472353966,"y":3511.268889925187,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"link","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNQdygRKfG8","color":"2"},{"id":41244089,"x":4200.871711517841,"y":3866.074942522145,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"link","url":"https://caizoryan.github.io/creativetalk","color":"2"},{"id":41244068,"x":3825.7221350628492,"y":3533.7179278794606,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"text","text":"# Gave a talk today at [Creative Coding Toronto]\n\nPresented a breakdown of the parts that constitute this publication tool I've been working on.

There is three parts to this process. HTML is written in input.html, the HTML in that file is embeded with javascript. Essentially this file is parsed and generates an output.js file that generates the index.html.\n\nThe syntax of input.html is as such:\n\nhtml\n \n\n<h1>%%+foo%%</h1>\n<p>%%+bar%%</p>\n\n<ul>\n%% for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { %%\n  <li> Item no. %%+ i %% </li>\n%% } %%\n</ul>\n\n\n\nThis will need an import file that will supply it the data (foo and bar), in this branch its called import.js and knowing what variables to import, compiling this will output a js file that looks something like:\n\n\njs\n// output.js\nimport fs from 'fs'\nimport {foo, bar} from './import.js'\n\nlet html = \"\"\n\nhtml += `<h1>`\nhtml += foo\nhtml += `</h1>\n<p>`\n\nhtml += bar\nhtml += `</p>\n<ul>\n`\nfor (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) { \n  html += `<li> Item no. `\n  html +=  i \n  html += `</li>`\n} \n\nhtml += `</ul>`\nfs.writeFileSync('./index.html', html);\n\n\none thing to note here is compare the syntax for %%+foo%% vs %% for (let ... %% lines. The + in the %%+foo%% line marks that expression as variable to be added to html variable whereas not adding the + puts the expression as it is into the javascript file. If we added 'for (let i = 0 ...' to html like, 'html += for (let i = 0 ...', it would produce an error, hence the distinction is important.\n\nWhich will generate:\n\nhtml\n<h1>hello world</h1>\n<p>this is a sentence and everything</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li> Item no. 0 </li>\n  <li> Item no. 1 </li>\n  <li> Item no. 2 </li>\n  <li> Item no. 3 </li>\n  <li> Item no. 4 </li>\n</ul>\n\n\nThis is essentially it. If you know javascript, you already know this ","color":"2"},{"id":37043808,"x":628.4017448509921,"y":950.7804886678862,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"text","text":"# Templater\n\nPlaying around with static site generation. Here is a basic draft I made for a static site generator which basically compiles to a js file. \n\nTrying out a programming paradigm where I try to think of the most simple raw solutions, like just putting js inside html, that makes a js file that accumalates a string and performs conditionals and for loops. The cool part is I don't have to implement any of that, I can leverage javascript as it is into this. So I get functions, loops, conditionals, all of it for free!\n\n+-> Templating also allows to template over js code :)\n\nAlso trying to do more things with css rather than js... here is a toggle that changes grid size based on html attribute, the js code here only toggles the attribute, everything else is css... Thought this was cool :)\n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/37043307/feddebc03a864a072cd6a098927b0e86.mp4?1748503705 controls loop></video></div>","color":"2"},{"id":37043307,"x":445.2263435616771,"y":60.943308797605425,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/37043307/feddebc03a864a072cd6a098927b0e86.mp4?1748503705","color":"2"},{"id":36928915,"x":2951.6193907473303,"y":3665.372184294649,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"text","text":"# New Era\n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/36928910/90519b4ada9d02b2c595e0dd752a2202.mp4?1748041073 controls loop></video></div>\n\nPlaying around with emacs in preparation; planning to do the SICP course in summer.","color":"2"},{"id":36928910,"x":4128.352585147349,"y":3080.863648464702,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/36928910/90519b4ada9d02b2c595e0dd752a2202.mp4?1748041073","color":"2"},{"id":36707883,"x":688.5236005501439,"y":2087.1451140584422,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/36707883/8ca0a7e397e15d4496b89e34d81588ab.mp4?1747245182","color":"2"},{"id":36707882,"x":3002.9211821628983,"y":4197.465546304235,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/36707882/ceacc34e64e6f17b8a286f94479afe04.mp4?1747245182","color":"2"},{"id":36707880,"x":3917.862805968899,"y":3685.5610145533296,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/36707880/3266e3a3b159aff6e63270ce762cac69.mp4?1747245181","color":"2"},{"id":36707806,"x":604.3776605173631,"y":4397.333407247949,"width":300,"height":300,"type":"text","text":"# Snake game updates\n\nSo here is what I came up with in the last 24 hours...\n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/36707883/8ca0a7e397e15d4496b89e34d81588ab.mp4?1747245182 controls loop></video></div>\n\nPretty neat right?\n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/36707880/3266e3a3b159aff6e63270ce762cac69.mp4?1747245181 controls loop></video></div>\n\nThe snake is made up of characters that spell out a message.\n\nOh wait whats that in the code?

The tsserver running for the editor responds a json blob with the whole navigation tree, and each item has a start position in it, the json viewer checks if a key is named 'start' and value is a number, and if it is, it will send a message to the editor to focus on the given position.\n\n##### Here is the speedrun:\n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/34902932/a182a02ffb87568fd71aaf230ca9b2bc.mp4?1740817793 controls loop></video></div>\n\n##### Here is the final functional demo\n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/34903037/a80310392a9bad84782e64434c2532a2.mp4?1740818785 controls loop></video></div>\n\nWill be working on this further. Will make it embedded in the editor so it can be searchable and one can easily navigate to symbols in the editor. \n\nAlso need to implement a scroll to active block position for the canvas. Will also look into the canvas library I'm using I think it has a zoom to rectangle function, so could think of saving and navigating to rectangles and saving these. And then I can have a save and navigate to certain views. \n\nAlso Thinking about how the navigation tree can be used for metaprogramming for javascript/typescript. For instance you can query the editor for current tree. Have a matcher, say match the global scope Editor. Then for each of Editor's methods do something. And that can be outputed and added to script. Or it could also be used to templativize making a display component for a class. Like if you make a display component for Editor, you could have a live feed of its internals as the editor runs. And if you have templativizer, it could generate render methods and match statements and generate a function which you can manually fill in. Hopefully this is verbose enough to let me remember this idea."},{"id":34902932,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":148.88963650959215,"y":748.4453108671357,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/34902932/a182a02ffb87568fd71aaf230ca9b2bc.mp4?1740817793"},{"id":34903037,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":181.25515378767545,"y":94.26340943617198,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/34903037/a80310392a9bad84782e64434c2532a2.mp4?1740818785"},{"id":34902911,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":196.11926093853353,"y":155.73321288872074,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/34902911/21ab37a806a8e27575f5f5d3b197fba9.mp4?1740817508"},{"id":34902887,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":555.1599366254031,"y":281.9978869677645,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/34902887/4918bb7f391b4368da9828069919c556.mp4?1740817193"},{"id":34902883,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":598.3871948023191,"y":657.4773946760441,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/34902883/b8ca703283b2d674ac713cb23b594020.mp4?1740817122"},{"id":34902867,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":772.6644935700081,"y":79.86332786029868,"type":"link","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrKj4hYic5A"},{"id":34902674,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":347.84359393337206,"y":50.48744096382416,"type":"text","text":"I love this guy's editor (towards the end)\n\n

So I can get tooling over the code. Tsserver is a package maintained by microsoft that lets you create a virtual filesystem in the browser and get diagnostics, completions, linting, refernce trees and basically tooling over your code. I had seen this was possible before but it is a whole task to set this up. So I started by getting this tsserver connected to the editor. This took much longer than I would have wanted it to.\n\n### Reconciling blocks, character positioning\nThe main issue with connecting the tsserver to the editor was reconciling the splitting of the file. The main function of the editor is to give you components that add up to the file. So a file is split up into smaller self contained chunks. This works all and good till the tsserver returns a {from, to} position for the diagnostics. \n\nEach codemirror instance can work with from and to position only relative to its own state and has no way of knowing what had come before or after it. The way I fixed it was adding start property in each blocks state which the parent of the block manages. So everytime you save a file it increments and assigns a start value to each block.\n\nThere was also a whole thing about managing a live version of the file seperate than the file that is saved for iframe to update (can't update iframe at every key press, but need autcomplete response at each key press, so have to maintain two versions..)\n\n### Autocomplete + Linting/Diagnostics\n---\n\n<div class="image"><img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiIzNDUwMzM4OC9vcmlnaW5hbF85NjMxZDBlZGRhZDk0Mzk5MzNjYWMzMzBjYmRiMjdjZC5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /></div>\n\nSo anyways got all of that working and here is a demo of getting a reference to functions defined in another block. And when you mistype it, or don't pass in expected value -> it shows you errors. \n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/34503395/73f5ec08fa4c391455563544fe6cefc1.mp4?1739426755 controls loop></video></div>\n\nI did some writing in it and honestly its pretty helpful and works pretty well, feels quite robust, not as good as neovim obviously but pretty great for a web editor.\n\n\n### Editor Reference passing\nFinally, this is something I will work further on tomorrow... but a sneak peak:\n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/34503079/58a90274a81d310b7ff23d05307a8121.mp4?1739425466 controls loop></video></div>\n\nI am able to pass the reference of Editor to the iframe, so the code running in the iframe is able to edit the editor. The below video will make it more clear, the editor outputs an iframe with buttons that onclick change the positioning of the editor.\n\n<div class="media"><video src=https://attachments.are.na/34503077/4b84b6ea05b94190be9c570f20e2f772.mp4?1739425465 controls loop></video></div>\n\n### File saves itself\nThe next one is going to be, creating a file in the editor that will output an interface and have functionality that will read the editor's state and save the state to a file locally using the fs functionality implemented on the local server. So will be writing a js script that will save itself using itself."},{"id":34503395,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":342.19263287187147,"y":280.3269743704262,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/34503395/73f5ec08fa4c391455563544fe6cefc1.mp4?1739426755"},{"id":34503388,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":97.43294207370691,"y":721.4499063691719,"type":"link","url":"https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiIzNDUwMzM4OC9vcmlnaW5hbF85NjMxZDBlZGRhZDk0Mzk5MzNjYWMzMzBjYmRiMjdjZC5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjE4MDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTgwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ=="},{"id":34503079,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":565.951509541387,"y":559.2963193341513,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/34503079/58a90274a81d310b7ff23d05307a8121.mp4?1739425466"},{"id":34503077,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":700.132831738527,"y":779.7399617374582,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/34503077/4b84b6ea05b94190be9c570f20e2f772.mp4?1739425465"},{"id":34495985,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":619.1544034105552,"y":130.91065415134523,"type":"text","text":"(B)it\n ^ \n |\n -- basically Git\n\nI wanna implement something like <a href = "https://github.com/LingDong-/srcsnap/tree/main"> this </a> for my workflow.\n\n<div class="image"><img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiIzNDQ5NTk3Ny9vcmlnaW5hbF84N2FmMzIwZDFlNTg3YjdjZTUxZDMxZmJkNWMwZGQyZi5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /></div>\n\nThe way I'm thinking is it would be a ui where I can see the screenshots (or can custom generate covers based on params) and those would be the branches of the code.

Last time this lead me to Rust, which was probably the wrong choice for the job, considering it obsfucates memory management through complex borrow checker patterns, though I did learn a lot in working in rust and started appreciating type systems. Anyways, I'm hoping <a href = "http://craftinginterpreters.com/"> crafting interpreters </a> will help me learn the memory management stuff through using either C or Zig (whatever I end up using)\n\nThe other — I've realised I am very much interested in this domain (programming languages) of CS. Although I'm not interested in optimizations and speed and all of that stuff (mostly cause that stuff is better left to the CS majors) I think where my intersection — being a graphic designer and also having this interest in CS — will benefit me is visual programming languages.\n\nWhen we think of Visual programming languages, we think scratch. The issue with most VPLs is that they are just a stylization over already existing Programming languages. Though what would a deterministic (or not) language look if the primitives were based on space and geometry. What would the Lexing -> AST -> Runtime chain look if syntax was based on interaction of lexemes in space.\n\n##### Why (i think) people don't experiment with this\n\nMostly because any programming language when being created is thought as text, so writing, testing, running and all the tooling an resources are made with this base assumption. Programs are files that are edited with text editors. \n\nNode based programming again is a frontend that outputs the same.\n\nThough we can have this sort of spatial programming if we have a graphical editor... and then diagnostics would be based on where objects are in space rather than textual syntax.\n\n[ps the vocabulary is lacking above, will come back to edit and refine this post]\n[TODO: add a WIP/Draft renderer for the feed]"},{"id":34238991,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":7.634227433710011,"y":265.2135144728253,"type":"link","url":"https://attachments.are.na/34238991/a541feabc0f0f76705257df50cd8e57b.mp4?1738609992"},{"id":34119321,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":531.7859810532722,"y":213.7983827130508,"type":"text","text":"Drafts\n\n<div class="image"><img src="https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiIzNDExOTMxOS9vcmlnaW5hbF9iNWIwOTU1ZDUwZWIwMWU5NWY1YzQzMTdkZjUxMDljYy5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTIwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ==?bc=0" /></div>"},{"id":34119319,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":45.30372525567884,"y":6.359543118805966,"type":"link","url":"https://images.are.na/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJhcmVuYV9pbWFnZXMiLCJrZXkiOiIzNDExOTMxOS9vcmlnaW5hbF9iNWIwOTU1ZDUwZWIwMWU5NWY1YzQzMTdkZjUxMDljYy5wbmciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjE4MDAsImhlaWdodCI6MTgwMCwiZml0IjoiaW5zaWRlIiwid2l0aG91dEVubGFyZ2VtZW50Ijp0cnVlfSwid2VicCI6eyJxdWFsaXR5Ijo3NX0sImpwZWciOnsicXVhbGl0eSI6NzV9LCJyb3RhdGUiOm51bGx9fQ=="},{"id":34119314,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":580.9300913544855,"y":655.288297044155,"type":"text","text":"The problem with visual programming languages.\n\n"},{"id":34118683,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":177.8622788424306,"y":226.09916488098006,"type":"text","text":"Localhost apps\n\nlocal servers (and proxy servers)\n\neasy ways to make apps, tools for yourself.\n\nthis obviously is abstracted simplicity, but is a really nice place to get started... \n\nbut javascripts dynamic programming just makes it such a nice language to iterate, prototype and just monkey around in..."},{"id":33989734,"width":300,"height":300,"color":"1","x":42.21471825688076,"y":231.19102172020456,"type":"text","text":"Tangible epistemology \n\nI’ve been invested in this term called tangible process and it’s been a long arduous process of attempting to define (for myself) what I mean when I say this term.\n\nIt started with my first ISP that I did in fall 2023, where I wanted to to make “Autonomous graphic tools that make process tangible”\n\nI know right? What does that even mean?\n\nReflecting back on it, I know now that what I was going after was a hole I’d dug for myself. \n\nWhat did I mean when I said tangible process, what I thought I meant was a well documented process where properties were thought as corresponding to relationships, so formal properties and relationships in a composition would be ‘meaningful’ and these can be semantically encoded as code elements.\n\nThe hole was me missing out on few key pieces. \n\n1. Not considering gestalt: even if properties are mapped to values, it’s not necessarily comprehensible to human perception, graphic compositions have to be thought holistically rather than stacking elements hoping that will yield complexity (it will yield a mess)\n2. Continuing from above, properties are a shallow shallow part of a composition, every time formal elements come together they produce something other than their sums, this is essentially gestalt and most times this is something that cannot necessarily be expressed semantically…\n3. Implementation is difficult but doable\n4. Any visual coding environments biggest challenge is dealing with abstraction \n5. Also visual programming doesn’t add anything if it’s just beautifying code, then it’s just stylization, to actually benefit from the paradigm of visual coding abstractions have to be managed (perhaps by creating graphic semantics) that would offload parsing code semantics to perceptual system.\n\nMy second ISP was fall of 2024\n\nI learned a lot in and since my previous ISP. This ISP I wanted to be vary of not falling into the pitfalls of the last one. \n\nFor this ISP I primarily worked mainly with a digital camera, and thought of the camera as a reconciler of computations. I did experiements where I set up a computaional enviromment and used the camera as an executor or runner of these computations. \n\nFor instance to add two images, setting up a screen that shows two images at regular intervals and taking a long exposure of them. So the screen, and the camera are co producing the computation. \n\nI then extended these to include gestures with hands, so timed zooming in with the lens of a camera and so on, different rhythms would produce different images. But the more interesting part for me was working in a process as such, your body would learn patterns and learn how to iterate and improvise, the body would know instinctively what direction to experiemnt or what certain gestures would look like in the final image and so on.\n\nThis is what can be termed 'tactile epistemology' a way of knowing that is rooted in body.\n\nAlongside these, I also attended a seminar by brook belsie at UOFT centre for culture and communication. The key take away from that seminar was the image doesn't contain itself within the surface of its material manifestation. It extends out to the context it was produced in creating an interpretation context to make its meaning. This would extend out to how Hayles defined cognition concluding images of being cognitive devices.\n\nSide track aside, this ISP helped me figure out what I had meant by tangible process. A way of engagin in process where the you are iterating a process and not the outcome, the process is the outcome. Writing code to produce graphic is in a sense similar to this, but programming on its own misses out on a large chunk of bodily cognition. (though there is something to be said of the process of programming itself, some programming practices are performances too, thinking of nvim, livecoding, keyboard muscle memory, etc) \n\nCreating a context where a body can learn a new meaning making context. Vision doesn't only mean the rendering of the world we experience. It is heavily entangled in tangibility, actions, perceptions, prehensions and more. \n\nGoing forward I am thinking about how to engage in this idea of tangible epistemolgy. This idea is super intriguing for me and I am thinking how I can engage with it from a graphic design position. \n\n1. Making essentially directly engages with the principles of tangible epistem...\n2. Graphics : Supplementing graphics with contexts of interaction to add (depth/value/meaning)? \n\nNumber 2 is essentially the crux of my current ISP. I still have to reframe the sentence.

But it seems (from a general scan of people writing and talking about it (blogs, youtube)) that it is a very enjoyable writing experience. Of course, it is a low level language, so that means you have to do manual memory allocation and such. I've always wanted to try making a project where I need to do manual memory allocation, just to learn about it so I was intrigued at this point. \n\nAlso the minimal abstraction thing reminded me of Devin from 100rabbits' talk: \n\n

So what if we had software that were graphic engines in this sense and you tinker it to fit your needs project to project and have some barebones versions for getting started as well.\n\nAlso recently found out about <span class="link"> <a target="_blank" href=https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/how-observable-runs>How Observable Runs / Observable | Observable <svg width="15" height="15" viewBox="0 0 15 15" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M8.51194 3.00541C9.18829 2.54594 10.0435 2.53694 10.6788 2.95419C10.8231 3.04893 10.9771 3.1993 11.389 3.61119C11.8009 4.02307 11.9513 4.17714 12.046 4.32141C12.4633 4.95675 12.4543 5.81192 11.9948 6.48827C11.8899 6.64264 11.7276 6.80811 11.3006 7.23511L10.6819 7.85383C10.4867 8.04909 10.4867 8.36567 10.6819 8.56093C10.8772 8.7562 11.1938 8.7562 11.389 8.56093L12.0077 7.94221L12.0507 7.89929C12.4203 7.52976 12.6568 7.2933 12.822 7.0502C13.4972 6.05623 13.5321 4.76252 12.8819 3.77248C12.7233 3.53102 12.4922 3.30001 12.1408 2.94871L12.0961 2.90408L12.0515 2.85942C11.7002 2.508 11.4692 2.27689 11.2277 2.11832C10.2377 1.46813 8.94398 1.50299 7.95001 2.17822C7.70691 2.34336 7.47044 2.57991 7.1009 2.94955L7.058 2.99247L6.43928 3.61119C6.24401 3.80645 6.24401 4.12303 6.43928 4.31829C6.63454 4.51355 6.95112 4.51355 7.14638 4.31829L7.7651 3.69957C8.1921 3.27257 8.35757 3.11027 8.51194 3.00541ZM4.31796 7.14672C4.51322 6.95146 4.51322 6.63487 4.31796 6.43961C4.12269 6.24435 3.80611 6.24435 3.61085 6.43961L2.99213 7.05833L2.94922 7.10124C2.57957 7.47077 2.34303 7.70724 2.17788 7.95035C1.50265 8.94432 1.4678 10.238 2.11799 11.2281C2.27656 11.4695 2.50766 11.7005 2.8591 12.0518L2.90374 12.0965L2.94837 12.1411C3.29967 12.4925 3.53068 12.7237 3.77214 12.8822C4.76219 13.5324 6.05589 13.4976 7.04986 12.8223C7.29296 12.6572 7.52943 12.4206 7.89896 12.051L7.89897 12.051L7.94188 12.0081L8.5606 11.3894C8.75586 11.1941 8.75586 10.8775 8.5606 10.6823C8.36533 10.487 8.04875 10.487 7.85349 10.6823L7.23477 11.301C6.80777 11.728 6.6423 11.8903 6.48794 11.9951C5.81158 12.4546 4.95642 12.4636 4.32107 12.0464C4.17681 11.9516 4.02274 11.8012 3.61085 11.3894C3.19896 10.9775 3.0486 10.8234 2.95385 10.6791C2.53661 10.0438 2.54561 9.18863 3.00507 8.51227C3.10993 8.35791 3.27224 8.19244 3.69924 7.76544L4.31796 7.14672ZM9.62172 6.08558C9.81698 5.89032 9.81698 5.57373 9.62172 5.37847C9.42646 5.18321 9.10988 5.18321 8.91461 5.37847L5.37908 8.91401C5.18382 9.10927 5.18382 9.42585 5.37908 9.62111C5.57434 9.81637 5.89092 9.81637 6.08619 9.62111L9.62172 6.08558Z" fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></a> </span>.

The report is quite interesting and written in a very approachable language. \n\nFrom the shallow reading that I did, it seems they wanted to have the two calendars, gregorian for civic purposes and the vikram samvat for festivals and cultural purposes.

\n\n2 things\n\n- it is a mechanical-digital calculator\n- yes, mechanical and digital. Digital being all computation is binary, the values in the gears cannot be between 1 and 2 or 7 and 8 etc, it can only be 1 or 2. The discrete nature makes it digital.
