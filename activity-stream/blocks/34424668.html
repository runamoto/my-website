<p > I'm also working on thesis a lot these days, gotta sit down this week and work on ISP (wtf i sound like anisha) </p>
<p > My thesis has been going really well tho, This week I've been working with Zaid and Saad. With Zaid we're making a soundscape for his screenplay. I recently read some of Naomi Waltan-smith the author of Turning Ears; Or, Ec(h)otechnics this sentence from one of per papers resonated with me:<br></br><strong > "Human ears evolved for frontal communication with other humans and away from lupine conical ears that picked up the environment. Humans have to decide which sounds we turn toward and how to deal with them by physically pivoting." </strong> </p>
<p > Zaid and I decided not to use any samples in our soundscape, chosing instead to create the sounds using miscellaneous objects such as glass vases, rolls of tape, water and our own vocals. Zaid remarked that the sounds we were producing using these objects gave him vivid mental imagery abou what he wanted to add to his screenplay. So instead of trying to emulate the audio usingthe screenplay, we decided to work the other way around and use the sounds as an inspiration for what is to come as our "artifact". </p></div>
