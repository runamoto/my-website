<p > Playing around with static site generation. Here is a basic draft I made for a static site generator which basically compiles to a js file. </p>
<p > Trying out a programming paradigm where I try to think of the most simple raw solutions, like just putting js inside html, that makes a js file that accumalates a string and performs conditionals and for loops. The cool part is I don't have to implement any of that, I can leverage javascript as it is into this. So I get functions, loops, conditionals, all of it for free! </p>
<p > +-> Templating also allows to template over js code :) </p>
<p > Also trying to do more things with css rather than js... here is a toggle that changes grid size based on html attribute, the js code here only toggles the attribute, everything else is css... Thought this was cool :) </p>
