<p > As you may or may not know, this feed runs on <a href = "https://are.na"> are.na </a>... another thing you may or may not know is that I have a self imposed constraint to have no javascript on this feed. So how do I add categories?<br></br>So they're going to be implemented as channels. I will connect blocks from the main channel into these category channels. So blocks can appear in multiple categories. And for the rendering of this there's two options. </p>
<p > The easiest way would be to just create pages for categories/tags/projects. So each channel would just turn into a file, and then on the main feed I can visit these pages. </p>
<p > The other... actually I'm just going to stick to the easiest way. I have too much other stuff to do :) </p></div>
