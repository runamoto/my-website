<p > I've been intrigued by gears and other forms of tangible mechanics and I'm hoping to start exploring these for my Independent study this semester. </p>
<p > Laser cutting at the Xfab studio is super cheap so I'm thinking just finding wooden scraps and cutting out various sizes of gears so I can modular-ly use them and make interchangeble mechanics that can be used with arduino/computer-vision/sound. </p>
<p > I did a first attempt at making a wooden slider today: </p>

<p > The gears are offset farther than ideal so the actual slider is very loose. Though this was the first time I used the laser cutters, so I'm quite happy I got something out of it. Now just gotta commit to this, iterate and build on top of this and see where it goes. </p>
