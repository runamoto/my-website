<p > Working on Are.na canvas to refresh my brain on concepts on how to make a draggable + canvas based tools. Going to make the interface for the publication tool a node based interface. So this is sort of the first draft/testing space for that. </p>

<p > I do wanna do a writeup for this... we'll see how that goes based on how much time I have in the coming days. </p>
<p > I need to add a search for channels, authentication and saving canvas data to channel to finish and publish this. Maybe clean up the UI and add some info too. </p>
<p > Using the new Are.na API for this. </p>

<p > Mostly things look same on the surface but the actual shape of the data is much different. Overall looks awesome! Super excited to make/re-make cool stuff with this. There's no write layer yet for the API so just going to use the older API to do writes for some time till they release the new version. </p></div>
