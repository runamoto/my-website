			<div class='block'><p > Artist Bio:<br></br>Omama Mahmood is a Pakistani artist (designer, film-maker) unconfined to a single medium. Currently, they are interested in the poetics of understanding what it means to “make with” nature, and observing what “collective decision making” looks like in different circles.<br></br>Often relating back to mycelial interconnectedness, Omama’s practice often folds into a meditative structure, engaged in multi-sensory observation, critical reflection, and relation. Inspired by the chaotics of nature – Omama, often with the help of her friends, seeks to engage in the unfolding of narratives and structures that surround her, often taking part in her own unfolding. A practice of presence, questioning and returning to oneself in the present moment. A dance of reciprocity witnessed and becoming. Seeking to return a new understanding to all things.<br></br>“... I see my function as quietly destroying myths, even those of my own making, in order to come closer and closer to reality and to accepting reality.”– May Sarton </p></div>
