			<div class='block'><p > what kind of things do you  notice making your own tools. When you're building entireity of functionality and tweaking each single detail, what kind of thoughts cross by: </p>
<p > Eg. Oh I really wanna be able to click this block to be active<br></br>which would be a note on me expecting -> (mouse and keyboard to work in coherence) </p>
<p > The thing come out of this would be 1. just an archive of ui/ux research kind of notes, but framed as my personal inclinations and how I incorporate them + 2.it would also be documentation for anyone else to learn and lastly the presentation of this documentation would be awesome to do in the editor, as -> editor views. </p>
<p > State -> which also includes the display (panzoom position included) + movement locked or something. </p>
<p > ^<br></br>|<br></br>_____ As files/websites. </p>
<p > Also I need to figure out bundling because that will show me how to export out webpages out of the editor (in the form of packages.) (resolve and push dependencies). This will also help me backend on are.na or something. </p>
<h2 > Other examples </h2>
<p > Autosave.<br></br>Some kind of confirmation when something is saved.<br></br>Need for feeling safe about your files, these past few weeks me working in the editor, it always feels so precarious. I also want to implement some sort of versioning because I am also scared of overwritting my files. So yeah, maybe another solution is using swp files and having a history of swp files. So its cache-versioing that you can just clear if you feel so or smth. </p>
<p > Git<br></br>I wonder if I could use git in a way where it tracks an entire folder, but since all my interactions with this folder happens through a node server, maybe each fs call can make a commit for any file change and then this commit can have a certain grammar, and I can query the commit tree for a single file's history that I can track. </p></div>
