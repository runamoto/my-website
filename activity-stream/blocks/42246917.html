			<div class='block'><h1 > Making a post from Canvas </h1>
<p > I'm updating this post from the canvas :) I think the canvas itself is almost ready and excited to share it online. There was some weird bug where when I saved the .canvas file to are.na channel and loaded it back in there was a JSON parsing error. Although it happened only for a specific block and hasn't happened since... so I dunno. Will see if this comes back later. </p>
<p > I still need to implement groups, and making new blocks. Maybe make the canvas infinite, like it can start of at a certain size and grow based on farthest away block or something. </p>
<h4 > Added mini-map and light mode </h4>

<p > The minimap doesn't respond to scale change because the math for that is going to be funky and I dont care enough at this moment for that type of accuracy so I'm just going to let that be. </p>
<h3 > Found some other really cool Are.na Canvases </h3>
<p > From this block -> <a href = "https://www.are.na/block/42109711"> BLOCK </a> </p>
<p > @Justin Liang's Hypercanvas https://www.are.na/block/40838466 Also their friend @Connie ⛱'s  link dump project. </p>
<p > @Nico Chilla linked  @fergarram ☠︎ ’s previous project suna.garden which sent me on a rabbit hole to <a href = "https://fergarram.online/-journal.html"> @fergrarram's journal </a> which I thought was really cool cause it reminded me of this space :) And also rediscovered unit.software~~ got super excited, tried to use it a little but ultimately gave up because I couldn't find resources to guide me through its mechanics... </p></div>
