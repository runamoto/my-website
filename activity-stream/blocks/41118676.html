Soaked them in water for a week (give or take) </p> </li><li > <p > Boiled phrag in water with two and a half tablespoons of washing soda (soda added while phrag was already in water) </p> </li><li > <p > Boiled for an hour until phrag was dark in colour and slightly limp. I stopped at about an hour mark because I was scared to over-boil. </p> </li><li > <p > Rinsed the phrag until water ran as clear as it could </p> </li><li > <p > Blended prag with some tap water in blender to form pulp </p> </li><li > <p > Distributed phrag pulp into tub of water </p> </li><li > <p > Used screen to "paper-make" - shallow side kept forcing itself up so it didn't work. deep side worked, but caused paper to stick to the screen- even after drying, it came out in pieces </p> </li> </ol></div>
