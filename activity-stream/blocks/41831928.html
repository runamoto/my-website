<ul > <li > <p > Some way to know when people visit this page. I don't want to do tracking of any kind, just some kind of acknowledgement or something that there is a presence in this space. Maybe its a button that viewers can click to be like, "Yo" </p> </li><li > <p > A comment system of some kind perhaps? </p> </li><li > <p > Link to other posts on the feed as references. This should be easy to implement as all the images and videos are already block references. For here I could link another block that probably talks about how this feed works on are.na or smth </p> </li><li > <p > Also wanna do a recap of this year. Things from this feed, things not on this feed, general reflection of tying things up and where to go as the new year approaches. </p> </li><li > <p > A tangential blog for longer form writing and project tracking/ case study kind of thingies. Where there's evergreen notes and maybe tutorials, WIP thoughts, drafts, essays, etc. I think this feed has been a really nice space for me to put stuff on that motivates and even structures my making. I want to have such a journal for long form projects now. </p> </li><li > <p > also wanna implement something like this: <a href = "https://liqvidjs.org/"> liqvid.js </a> so I can have like tutorials, or showcase something or present something without actually making a video but writing it in sort of an essay but it turns into a video. I could probably narrate it and use the transcript... smth smth. </p> </li> </ul></div>
