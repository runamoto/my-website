<p > As some of you may know I have been working on an Editor. I won't go in depth to explain exactly what it is, but essentially its a code editor that outputs to an iframe, and the idea is to be able to make it modular and interoperable and be able to edit the editor itself as you work in it. </p>
<p > I've been struggling to figure out what to name it, but after careful consideration, I have decided to name it editor. </p>
<p > I think the non specificity of what kind of editor it is, is interesting. It can be a code editor, but it can also be a photo editor or a vector editor or a json editor or a pdf editor, etc etc. </p>
<p > Also thinking, as a designer I think it would be cool if we could have a basic engine kind of thing for graphics and then we could just design our own tools. For instance game (engines) design tools are just gui based programming that make it super easy to make a game. So what if we had software that were graphic engines in this sense and you tinker it to fit your needs project to project and have some barebones versions for getting started as well. </p>

This is essentially what I'm thinking, but a little more barebones. Locally hostable, easily implementable, barebones that are more collection of concepts rather than a monolithic implementation. And the components I make in those would be the thing to put effort into. </p>
