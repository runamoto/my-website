That's to say, ever since I decided to go through with this, I've been feeling so content with my place in the world. The clouds are many thsi time of year, and moving at winds pace, my sense of self withers knowing it's still winter and I have so much time ahead of me. At the same time, I've been engaging in conversations about our "end of year" explorations about ourselves and such. Recently, Sanchari put together a “playlist”, of books and films that she spent 2025 with, and asked me to send in a few of mine too. Though this year hasn't ended for me yet, it felt like a nice checkpoint to come back to all the media I've consumed since spring of 2025. I am also making an active effort to use less conclusive language about the "end" of the year as the Gregorian calendar entails it, and rather, I'll mimic the clouds and ride the wind. The year is not yet over, we are still in hibernation. </p>
