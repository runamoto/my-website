I can't wait til all of our friends have their own blogs and we can finally abandon the troglodyte that is Instagram once and for all. We were discussing implementing a newsletter type thing for every time we update the blog as well, so that we can alert each other when there's a new blog post + writing piece worth sharing with each other. Aaryan and I will try to figure it out. Until then, we make the habit of checking each others websites instead of opening Instagram, which I still believe is good progress :) </p></div>
