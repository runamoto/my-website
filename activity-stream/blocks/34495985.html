<p > The way I'm thinking is it would be a ui where I can see the screenshots (or can custom generate covers based on params) and those would be the branches of the code. Git branches sound very interesting in concept, but anytime I think of using them and consider merging and all of that stuff, I feel like its going to be not worth using because it will just escalate complexity and things are prone to go wrong. So if I could implement something based on git branches, I'll figure out how it works and then maybe I can use it... and maybe think of how I can engage in process differently using this branching sort of structure to iterate in different directions.... </p>
<p > Like there can be multiple ways of implementing something... and whatever seems promising you work on it in parallel. </p></div>
