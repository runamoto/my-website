<p > Added project pages, you can probably see this on the right here -> </p>
<p > There's also some new view options. There's a list option which will display only the first line of each block. And if you click it you can visit the block as a page. The block pages don't have any css as of yet but will add these soon. </p>
<p > Hopefully this will be useful if I wanna link specific posts... </p>
<p > Something I wanna add here is a way for people to let me know they were here :)<br></br>I don't wanna add tracking of any sort cuz that suckssss. But I wanna add like a hi - five emoji or smth where people can click it which would log a visit of some kind... </p></div>
