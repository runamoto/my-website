						<h1 > Printed Traces (of Scent and Wreckage) Rose Nordin workshop </h1>
<p > A beautiful synchronicity befell me this January when I found out <a href = "https://rosenord.in/"> Rose Nordin </a> was going to be facilitating a workshop at OCAD. I had been admiring her work just a month prior when I found out she was the designer at <a href = "https://www.silverpress.org/collections/spiral-house"> Spiral House </a>.(1) </p>
<p > The workshop centered around olfactory memory as a trigger for language, gesture, and graphic form as opposed to the visual, which through images outputted from Pinterest, are.na, Instagram etc. is what designers often default to, for ideation/inspiration. These tools are arguably useful in their own right(2), but (for image) when we rely on a secondary source, the work becomes less imbued by ones own experiences. </p>
<p > Hence, because the experience of SMELL is removed from the virtual (or GUI?) experience, relying on our own "secondary research"(3) of olfactory memory and ones own lived experiences in relation to it, can be a good place to start. </p>
<p > So really, the question here was how we can work towards a truly embodied (through the nose) and reflexive (through memory and recall) design process. </p>

						<p > successfully haunted <a href = "https://www.are.na/aiyana-aaaaaaaa/index"> Aiyana </a> into making her own blog mwahaha. I can't wait til all of our friends have their own blogs and we can finally abandon the troglodyte that is Instagram once and for all. We were discussing implementing a newsletter type thing for every time we update the blog as well, so that we can alert each other when there's a new blog post + writing piece worth sharing with each other. Aaryan and I will try to figure it out. Until then, we make the habit of checking each others websites instead of opening Instagram, which I still believe is good progress :) </p>

						<p > Operating at a different year time-zone than usual has been quite disorienting. That's to say, ever since I decided to go through with this, I've been feeling so content with my place in the world. The clouds are many thsi time of year, and moving at winds pace, my sense of self withers knowing it's still winter and I have so much time ahead of me. At the same time, I've been engaging in conversations about our "end of year" explorations about ourselves and such. Recently, Sanchari put together a “playlist”, of books and films that she spent 2025 with, and asked me to send in a few of mine too. Though this year hasn't ended for me yet, it felt like a nice checkpoint to come back to all the media I've consumed since spring of 2025. I am also making an active effort to use less conclusive language about the "end" of the year as the Gregorian calendar entails it, and rather, I'll mimic the clouds and ride the wind. The year is not yet over, we are still in hibernation. </p>

						<p > Artist Bio:<br></br>Omama Mahmood is a Pakistani artist (designer, film-maker) unconfined to a single medium. Currently, they are interested in the poetics of understanding what it means to “make with” nature, and observing what “collective decision making” looks like in different circles.<br></br>Often relating back to mycelial interconnectedness, Omama’s practice often folds into a meditative structure, engaged in multi-sensory observation, critical reflection, and relation. Inspired by the chaotics of nature – Omama, often with the help of her friends, seeks to engage in the unfolding of narratives and structures that surround her, often taking part in her own unfolding. A practice of presence, questioning and returning to oneself in the present moment. A dance of reciprocity witnessed and becoming. Seeking to return a new understanding to all things.<br></br>“... I see my function as quietly destroying myths, even those of my own making, in order to come closer and closer to reality and to accepting reality.”– May Sarton </p>

						<p > omama mahmood is an corporeal manifestation of puerile conciousness who swims into the oceans of moss covered soil and jumps out like a fish who is soon to be devoured by the caniballistic nature of ravenous man! Through their practice they seek to transfigure air into a mutable substance that enters through the vessel called “nose” and leaves through the pores of the flesh-lined body as acceptance<br></br>that we,<br></br>are all,<br></br>eating,<br></br>each other,<br></br>constantly<br></br>Their methodologies deny the obdurate mass of hot air that often leaves the tongues of man, Including our own. The dismemberment of the natural world by technology link rot link rot link rot link rotting flesh of deep sea cables and the sea creatures that suffered the debilitation of their 12 storey condominiums because of it. </p>
