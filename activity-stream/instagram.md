# Using instagram

I've been off instagram for almost the past 3 years. And I'm extremely happy with that decision and it has brought nothing but joy to me. However I think I need to interact with it for professional reasons.

So I've been thinking of alternative ways I could use it. One approach was Amir mentioning how he would have a system to only check and update it on one day in a month. So all stuff would get posted then. That I thought was interesting.

The one I just thought of was maybe, all the content and posts point outside of instagram. So for instance all of them are screenshots of my feed.a-p.space or website sketches. Or links to other peoples websites, etc. The whole point would be that these would all point outside of instagram. A link in bio interface that could open like instagram feed view and have links mentioned in each of the posts for easy access, so it is easy to get out of instagram as you enter it instead of being trapped in it.

This is an idea for an experiment. Perhaps I'll try it out.
