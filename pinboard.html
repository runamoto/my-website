          <p>Weekly Check-in</p>

          <p>
            I keep forgetting to update this because my head is so full of
            stuff. So I'm going to make this a weelky check in thing, not just
            for documentation purposes, but also to practice VIM and for my
            future self.
          </p>

            Selma and I are hosting a workshop this week. It centeres around
            discussion and dialouge so there isn't much for us to do other than
            to propagate ideas and get people talking to eachother about things
            that they deem important in the context of the burning world and
            living in one of the most industrialized places in the world.
            Thinking about how to sever hierarchy in these kinds of situations,
            the goal is not to go up and present, but rather, be apart of the
            conversation. We can only do that when we know nobody thinks of us
            as a "speatheadder" of the workshop and we don't impost that onto
            ourselves as we converse. An idea was to have an omnipotent narrator
            voice over the whole thing. That way, Not only Selma and I get to be
            part of the workshop (mentally) completely, but there will also be a
            factor of uncontrollability, taking away the need for control and
            directionality on our parts.

            Morning everyone!! It's been a while. I recently got my Holga film
            developed! The
            <a
              href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070118212754/http://shop.lomography.com/holga/history/"

            is really interesting because it's actually a plastic "toy camera",
            introduced in Hong Kong to bring photography to the working class
            during a technological boom and trend in photography as a hobby.
            <br /><br />The camera was introduced to me by Roderick Grant for
            the reason that it was an affordable, beginner friendly camera that
            who's beauty is in it's constraints. I picked one up for my birthday
            from a guy on facebook marketplace and took it to Dubai where I took
            most of the pictures and they came out better than I could have
            imagined

            BTW!! I've gotten better at using VIM, I made a little cheat sheet
            on my sticky note app and made it so it's on top of vs code so
            that's been suuper helpful.

            I made a type specimen for my typeface and printed it out on pink

            I'm currently typing this using VIM which is kinda difficult becuse
            I'm not allowing myself to use any of the arrow keys or my trackpad
            whilst typing in my html file. Its hard to get used to but I'm
            already betting better compared to two days ago. I type better when
            im not thinking too hard about it becuas my fingers are already used
            to it. Our body is so phenomenal in thay way...So much memory, so
            much capacity, so much love!!!

            How does one make written notes "real" is the question Ive been
            pondering. I have a plethora of information, theory and research
            I've collected from my independant study last year but I am
            struggling to find a medium that makes clear the effort. The visual
            language is a mirror. â€”11.02.25

            Yooo look who finally got a domain name!! I'm still unsure about it,
            but it was the cheapest from my top three options. The other ones
            were omama.run, omama.place... I still keep typing and telling
            people its omama.cafe r.i.p.

            I'm also working on thesis a lot these days, gotta sit down this
            week and work on ISP (wtf i sound like anisha)
          </p>
          <p>
            My thesis has been going really well tho, This week I've been
            working with Zaid and Saad. With Zaid we're making a soundscape for
            his screenplay. I recently read some of Naomi Waltan-smith the
            author of Turning Ears; Or, Ec(h)otechnics this sentence from one of
            per papers resonated with me:
          </p>
          <h2>
            "Human ears evolved for frontal communication with other humans and
            away from lupine conical ears that picked up the environment. Humans
            have to decide which sounds we turn toward and how to deal with them
            by physically pivoting."
          </h2>
          <p>
            Zaid and I decided not to use any samples in our soundscape, chosing
            instead to create the sounds using miscellaneous objects such as
            glass vases, rolls of tape, water and our own vocals. Zaid remarked
            that the sounds we were producing using these objects gave him vivid
            mental imagery abou what he wanted to add to his screenplay. So
            instead of trying to emulate the audio usingthe screenplay, we
            decided to work the other way around and use the sounds as an
            inspiration for what is to come as our "artifact".
