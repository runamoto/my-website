<div class=opening-letter><h2> Introduction </h2>
<br>
<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p> It seems arbitrary to give a website an introduction; after all, it does not have to abide by laws such as that of a book or letter...Perhaps a webpage dedicated to writing deserves it's own rules...mwahahahaha. </p>
<p> Before this blog, I had my <a href= "pinboard.html">pinboard.</a> The issue with it was that, everytime I had to make a new post, I would have to write it down on VSCode which as we know is not a great text editor...Hence, my pinboard was stagnant for a lot of the year because I was heavily unmotivated to deal with that. <br>
My next option was to use are.na blocks, but that would prove difficult for a few reasons: Are.na blocks aren't great text editors either. I was once writing a very compassionate, sincere essay on are.na, I was typing away and accidentally pressed a key that I shouldnt have. BOOM, all my writing, gone. I took a break from arena after that...<br>

Finally, the blogs most recent evolution, is this. using markdown files and images embedded through are.na links enables me to be able to edit text in a less precarious, more acessible way.<br>
<br>
<br>You will find that this blog is a mixure of my last pinboard, riddled with saparatic and random publishings from throughout the year, as well as others that are more consice. Please bear with me as I am working on a system to organize them. For now, Enjoy the mess I've made over time.<br>
<br>
<p>Lotus,</p>
<p>—Runa </p></div>
